### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [debugger101](https://www.hitzhangjie.pro/debugger101.io), describes how to develop a go debugger
  - [gorpc101](https://www.hitzhangjie.pro/gorpc101), describes how to develop a microservice framework
  - [libmill](https://www.hitzhangjie.pro/libmill-book), describes the libmill go-style coroutine library
  - [go internals](https://www.hitzhangjie.pro/go-internals/), (try to) describes nearly every aspect of golang internals
  - ~~[go internals](https://www.hitzhangjie.pro/go-internals-v0/), (try to) describes nearly every aspect of golang internals~~
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - [distributed sytem](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/distributed-system-series)
  - [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.feisky.xyz/)
  - [cpu architecture](https://docs.boom-core.org/en/latest/sections/intro-overview/boom-pipeline.html)
- ⚡ Fun fact: 
  - keep writing [blogs](https://www.hitzhangjie.pro/#%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2) every week
- 🦮 Useful utilities:
  - [toc](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/toc), scans your folders and generate SUMMARY.md automatically
  - [notion](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/notion), read CSV exported by Notion and generates markdowns with liquid tags
  - [wc](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/wc), an alternate to GNU `wc`, which outputs more clearer
  - [rm](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/rm), an alternate to GNU `rm`, which effectively reduces mistakes of deletion
